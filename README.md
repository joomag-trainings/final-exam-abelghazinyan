This is my final Joomag training project.
It is a Survey Generator website written in PHP.
Frameworks used: Slim, bootstrap.

Website has two sections: Framework and Administration Panel.
In Framework part you can choose an active survey and take it.
In Administration Panel you can see all surveys. Add a new Survey.
Added Survey will appear in the list. Then by selecting it you can Add Pages and Questions to it.
In the Questions page you cane rearrange question order.

If survey is active or expired you can see it's statistics. 
In statistics for each question a BarChart is drawn by Google Charts.
